As a result, there has been increased pressure on the presiding officer to enforce drug laws and tackle drug abuse in the United States.\n\n## Related Background\nIn recent years, there have been numerous media reports of U.S. presidents, including Justin Bieber and Michelle Obama, using substances like ritonavir (used for hepatitis C), methamphetamines, and other recreational drugs. These reports have led to numerous backlash from the public and some legal campaigns to end the use of substances in the presidency.\n\n## Defaming example\nA prime example of President Donald Trump's use of substances is that he has been in and out of rehab in the past and testified about his history of substance abuse in a 2018 interview. Details of his use of substances are widely reported and trending on social media around the world. The President's reliance on substances has been described by newspapers and media outlets as a 'betrayal' of the American people and his presidency's image.\n## Conclusion\nThe investigation of President's substance use has been ongoing, leading some experts to theorize about why the current President has been reclusive and not as open about his substance use as President Obama was. Public scrutiny of President's substance use may lead to those in power, not to openly promote their views or policies on substance abuse. As allies of President Obama, athletes, and politicians worldwide, it is imperative that we open conversations about substance use and the devastating impact it has on individuals, families, and communities around the globe.\n## References\nI.

The President's reliance on substances has been described by newspapers and media outlets as a 'betrayal' of the American people and his presidency's image. \nIn another example, allegations have surface that he was in and out of rehab due to certain substances, particularly methamphetamine. This news prompted significant criticism from human beings and social policy representatives' sectors concerning the President's use of substances, that leaves people breathing that he may be breaking the law and imitating pattern abuse due to substance abuse. Some of the interview might be organized and going in a similar amount as to the abuse considering the news in the meantime. This is a recent figure of abuse, and it can be used as an example. \n## By Donald R. Coulter\nPart 3",
